Islamist-led rebels declared that they had taken Damascus in a lightning offensive on Sunday, sending President Bashar al-Assad fleeing and ending five decades of Baath rule in Syria.
<p>
Residents in the Syrian capital were seen cheering in the streets, as the rebel factions heralded the departure of "tyrant" Assad, saying: "We declare the city of Damascus free".
<p>
AFPTV images from Damascus showed rebels firing into the air at sunrise, with some flashing the victory sign and crying "Allahu akbar", or God is greatest.
<p>
Some climbed atop a tank in celebration, while others defaced a toppled statue of Assad's father, Hafez.
<p>
"I can't believe I'm living this moment," tearful Damascus resident Amer Batha told AFP by phone.
<p>
"We've been waiting a long time for this day," he said, adding: "We are starting a new history for Syria." 
<p>
The president's alleged departure, which was also reported by a war monitor, comes less than two weeks after the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group launched its campaign challenging more than five decades of rule by the Assad family.
